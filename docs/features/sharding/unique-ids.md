# Unique IDs

!!! note "Experimental feature"
    This feature is new and experimental. Please [report](https://github.com/pgdogdev/pgdog/issues) any issues you encounter.

To generate unique identifiers, regular PostgreSQL databases use [sequences](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createsequence.html). For example, `BIGSERIAL` and `SERIAL` columns get their values by calling:

```
SELECT nextval('sequence_name');
```

This guarantees that these columns contain unique and monotonically increasing integers.

<!--The `BIGSERIAL` data type is used to identify rows in ORMs like ActiveRecord (Rails) and Django, so making them work in sharded databases is pretty important.-->

If your database is sharded however, using sequences will create identical IDs for different rows on different shards. To address this, PgDog can generate unique 64-bit signed identifiers internally, based on the system clock.

## How it works

The unique ID algorithm implemented by PgDog is based on three inputs:

- Current system time in milliseconds
- Unique identifier for the PgDog node (e.g. `hostname`)
- An internal sequence

The unique node identifier ensures that two different instances of PgDog can't produce the same ID at the same time. Additionally, the internal sequence allows for submillisecond ID creation in very busy deployments.

Once configured, you can fetch unique IDs using a standard SQL command:

=== "Command"
    ```postgresql
    SHOW pgdog.unique_id;
    ```
=== "Output"
    ```
       unique_id
    ----------------
     29888761298944

    ```

### Configuration

#### Node identifier

To make IDs _globally_ unique, a different node identifier is required for each instance in a PgDog deployment.

If you're using our [Helm chart](https://github.com/pgdogdev/helm), this is taken care of automatically when deploying it as a [`StatefulSet`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) resource:

```yaml
statefulSet:
  enabled: true
```

Otherwise, you need to ensure each PgDog instance has a different **`NODE_ID`** environment variable configured at startup. The variable can contain anything, as long as it ends with `-<number>` (hyphen and a number).

For example, if you have a three node deployment, they could be identified as follows:

=== "Node 1"
    ```bash
    export NODE_ID=pgdog-prod-1
    ```
=== "Node 2"
    ```bash
    export NODE_ID=pgdog-prod-2
    ```
=== "Node 3"
    ```bash
    export NODE_ID=pgdog-prod-3
    ```

When configured correctly, you're able to get each node's identifier by querying the [admin](../../administration/index.md) database, for example:

=== "Command"
    ```
    SHOW INSTANCE_ID;
    ```
=== "Output"
    ```
      instance_id
    ----------------
      pgdog-prod-1
    ```

!!! note "Maximum number of nodes"
    Due to how the ID generation algorithm is implemented, PgDog allows up to a maximum
    of **1023** instances in the same deployment.


#### Minimum ID

If you're migrating data from an existing database, you can ensure that all IDs generated by PgDog start at a minimum value. This is configurable in [`pgdog.toml`](../../configuration/pgdog.toml/general.md), like so:

```toml
[general]
unique_id_min = 5_000_000
```

When set, all generated IDs are guaranteed to be larger than this value.
