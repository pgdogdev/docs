# Metrics

PgDog exposes real-time metrics and statistics about clients, servers, connection pools, and more. They are available via two media:

1. The [admin database](../administration/index.md)
2. OpenMetrics (e.g., Prometheus) endpoint

## Admin database

You can connect to the admin database using any PostgreSQL client. It supports custom commands, documented [here](../administration/index.md).

!!! note "Prepared statements"
    The admin database doesn't support prepared statements or transactions. Make sure your Postgres client
    is only using simple queries.

    === "Python"
        ```python
        import psycopg2
        conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=admin host=127.0.0.1 port=6432 user=admin password=admin")
        conn.autocommit = True
        cur = conn.cursor()

        cur.execute("SHOW POOLS")
        pools = cur.fetchall()
        ```
    === "psql"
        ```bash
        PGPASSWORD=admin psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6432 -U admin admin -c 'SHOW POOLS'
        ```

## OpenMetrics

[OpenMetrics](https://openmetrics.io/) is a standard for displaying metrics that can be ingested by a multitude of agents, e.g., Datadog, Prometheus, etc. The metrics are shown in a human-readable text format
and available from an HTTP endpoint.

### Configuration

The endpoint is disabled by default. You can enable it by configuring which port it should run on:

```toml
[general]
openmetrics_port = 9090
```

This setting can only be configured on startup. Once configured, the endpoint will be available on `http://0.0.0.0:9090` and can be queried with any HTTP client, for example:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:9090/metrics
```

#### Namespace

To avoid name conflicts between PgDog's metrics and your own, you can namespace these metrics with a configurable prefix:

```toml
[general]
openmetrics_namespace = "pgdog_"
```

!!! note "Prefix format"
    Some OpenMetrics implementations don't support special characters in the metric name (e.g., periods, commas, etc.). In that case,
    you can use an underscore (`_`) instead.

## Available metrics

The following metrics are exported via the OpenMetrics endpoint:
