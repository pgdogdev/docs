# PgDog EE

PgDog **E**nterprise **E**dition is a version of PgDog that contains additional features for at scale monitoring and deployment of sharded (and unsharded) PostgreSQL databases.

Unlike PgDog itself, PgDog EE is closed source and available upon the purchase of a license. It comes with a hosted management dashboard which provides real-time visibility into PgDog's operations.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|-|-|
| [Running queries](active_queries.md) | Instant view into queries running through PgDog. |
| [Query plans](query_plans.md) | Root cause slow queries in seconds with automatic PostgreSQL query plans. |
| [Real-time metrics](metrics.md) | All PgDog metrics, delivered with second-precision through a dedicated link. |
| Query blocker | Terminate all instances of a slow query with a button click and prevent them from running again. |
